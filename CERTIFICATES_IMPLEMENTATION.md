# Certifications & Achievements Section - Implementation Details

## Overview of Changes

I've implemented a professional two-column layout for your Certificates & Achievements section with the following features:

1. **Professional Two-Column Layout**

   - Right side: Certificate details (title, organization, date, and description)
   - Responsive design that stacks vertically on mobile devices

2. **Enhanced Modal Viewing Experience**
   - Full-screen modal for viewing certificates in detail
   - Zoom functionality (both buttons and mouse wheel)
   - Pan/drag capability when zoomed in
   - Zoom percentage indicator
   - Reset zoom button

3. **Professional Styling**
   - Soft shadows and gradient backgrounds
   - Smooth animations and transitions
   - Hover effects for certificate cards
   - Improved typography with gradient text headings
