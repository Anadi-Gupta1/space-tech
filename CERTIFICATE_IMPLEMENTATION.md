   - Displays individual certificates with image, title, organization, and description
   - Handles click events for opening the certificate in full screen

2. **Certificate Modal Component** (`components/sub/certificate-modal.tsx`)
   - Provides full-screen view of certificates
   - Includes close button and keyboard navigation (Escape key)
   - Accessible implementation with proper focus management

3. **Certificates Section Component** (`components/main/certificates.tsx`)
   - Main section component that displays all certificates
   - Organized by NASA and ISRO sections
   - Responsive grid layout for different screen sizes

## Data Structure

Added to `constants/index.ts`:
```typescript
export const CERTIFICATES = [
  {
    id: "nasa-globe",
    title: "NASA GLOBE Program Citizen Scientist",
    organization: "NASA GLOBE Program",
    date: "July 2025",
    image: "/images/certificates/nasa-globe.jpg",
    description: "Recognition as an active volunteer contributor to NASA's GLOBE Program..."
  },
  // Additional certificates...
]
```

## Integration

1. Added to main page layout in `app/page.tsx`
2. Updated navigation links in `constants/index.ts`

2. **Refine Content**:
   - Update certificate descriptions in `constants/index.ts` if needed
   - Add any additional certificates you may receive

3. **Testing**:
   - Test responsive behavior on different screen sizes
   - Ensure modal opens and closes properly
   - Verify all navigation links work correctly

4. **Accessibility**:
   - Ensure all images have descriptive alt text
   - Test keyboard navigation throughout the section
